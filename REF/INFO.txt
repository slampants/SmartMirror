## Screen Resolution/Settings
Getting the raspberry pi to output the right resolution over HDMI for the VSDISPLAY 14.9" (https://a.co/d/g5K2PMR) is simple, though not immediately straightforward.

The TL;DR is that it requires you to modify settings in the `/boot/config.txt` file. Documentation for the Pi vis-a-vis video/monitor settings:

I ended up finding the settings I needed via this youtube video:

Ultimately it only required adding three lines. I modified what the youtube video says to do, by adding `display_hdmi_rotate=3` which rotates the output 270ยบ, since I have the monitor vertically oriented.

For convenience, I have copied the `config.txt` file that works into this REF folder, so you can just copy it into the `/boot/` folder.
